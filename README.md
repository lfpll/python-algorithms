This is my own methodology on how to learn Algorithms

This https://chrisdoescoding.com/posts/5/ post showed me that there is more people out there that also have this problems.

1. My goal is to everyday Watch one of the youtube about the algorithms (not about the solution).
2. Try to Implement in python
3. If not Sucessful look for hints
4. Try Again
5. Look for solution

1. Solve a leet code puzzle using Chris Solution
2. Don't measure time on that, just don't waste to much time planning
